This was a project for ECE 212.
The logic required the ability to take in up to 4 quarters, dispense an item, and return change.
It also required a return-all-quarters function.
If the needed change did not match the chosen item's cost, the machine did not dispense.
Finally, the machine needed work with only 2 d flip-flop storage bits. These were used as a state machine.
The physical circuit started out GORGEOUS, and my wire management was some of my best, 
but due to quite a few broken chips (gotta love 404s), drained batteries, and a lack of time, 
I was forced to abandon any hope of wire organization.

NOTE: Netlists are unprofessional due to a change in requirements of the project, and I didn't have time to fix them,
so I stuck with my drafts.

Software used: I primarily used Google Drawings because I was unable to access KiCad at the time (software issues).
While this was not exactly optimal, it taught me a lot about working under restrictions, regarding documentation and schematics.
