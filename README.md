This was a project for ECE 212.
The logic required the ability to take in up to 4 quarters, dispense an item, and return change.
It also required a return all quarters function.
If the needed change did not match the chosen item's cost, the machine did not dispense.
Finally, the machine needed work with only 2 flip flop storage bits. These were used as a state machine.
The physical circuit started out GORGEOUS, and my wire management was some of my best, 
but due to quite a few broken chips (gotta love 404s), drained batteries, and a lack of time, 
I was forced to abandon any hope of wire organization.
